# Introduction

Package: `broom`
This version: 0.1
Date: 2018/9/5

Author: Richard (Dien Giau Bui), at [buidiengiau@gmail.com](mailto:buidiengiau@gmail.com)

I write this package to replicate the `R::broom` package. In principles, this package allows us to easliy tidy the results from a regression.

# Install

To setup in local computer, download this package into your computer and use the command line to drive into this folder:

Then run: `pip install .`

To setup this development version directly from `github`, we can run:

`pip install --upgrade https://github.com/diengiau/broom/tarball/master`

# Examples

I wrote some examples how to use this package in a regression analysis and how to incorporate it into a wider world of `tidyverse`-related packages such as `plydata`. The examples are in the `examples` folder (will updated soon).
